## About The Project

This application leverages OpenAI's API to generate images based on user-provided text prompts. The project is built using a full stack with Node.js, Express, React, and MongoDB to ensure a robust and scalable solution. Users can input text prompts and receive AI-generated images in response.

## Features

- **Image Generation**: Generate high-quality images based on textual descriptions using OpenAI's advanced models.
- **Prompt Management**: Save and manage text prompts and generated images in the MongoDB database.
- **User Interface**: Intuitive React-based front end for submitting prompts and viewing generated images.
- **Backend API**: Node.js and Express server to handle requests, interact with the OpenAI API, and manage data with MongoDB.
